## Hi, I am Kavya Ramisetty ðŸ‘‹

I am a Staff Engineer and a Decision Science Researcher. I am passionate about decisions derived by processing uncertain information and believe in AI's explainability power to improve people's understanding about situations and outcomes. I want to transfer my limited knowledge to others and guide them into this vast field through writing, teaching, and mentoring.
